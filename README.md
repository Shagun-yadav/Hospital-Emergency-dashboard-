# Hospital-Emergency-dashboard(Interactive Dashboard Using MS Excel)

## Project Objective
Developed a Power BI dashboard for Hospital Emergency Room Analysis to enhance operational efficiency and support data-driven decision-making. The dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor patient flow, analyze key metrics, and identify areas for improving service quality and resource management.
## KPI's Requirement 
Number of Patients:
Count the total number of patients visiting the ER each day.
Show a daily trend with an area sparkline to spot patterns like busy days or seasonal trends.
Average Wait Time:
Find the average time patients wait to see a medical professional.
Use an area sparkline to track daily changes and highlight days with longer wait times that might need improvements.
Patient Satisfaction Score:
Check the average daily satisfaction score of patients to assess service quality.
Use an area sparkline to show trends, spot drops in satisfaction, and link them to busy times or challenges.
